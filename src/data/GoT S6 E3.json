Ser Oswell Whent was the third Kingsguard present. When Ned says he looked for them on the Trident, it is Ser Gerold Hightower, rather than Ser Arthur Dayne, who replies that they were not there, and Ser Oswell declares, \"Woe to the Usurper if we had been.\"\nThere is no mention in the books of Arthur Dayne wielding two swords at once. He instead uses his family's ancestral great sword, Dawn, a pale white blade that glows faintly.\nDespite the superb skills he displayed before his death, Ser Arthur is shown to be much more modest on the show than he seemed in the book as shown when he wishes Ned \"good fortune in the wars to come.\" In the books, Ser Arthur comes across as somewhat overconfident, like his two sworn brothers, saying, \"Our knees do not bend so easily.\"\nIt is unknown who killed whom and how the dead perished at the Tower of Joy, only who survived: Ned Stark and Howland Reed."
